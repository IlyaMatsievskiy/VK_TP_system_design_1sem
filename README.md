## Project Details

1. **Feature Description**  
   - The feature enables users to play demo versions of games online without downloading, enhancing the user experience and accessibility.

2. **RFC Document**  
   - We prepared a detailed RFC (Request for Comments) document outlining the feature's goals, technical requirements, user flows, and potential challenges.  

3. **Task Formulation**  
   - Tasks were defined to implement the feature, including API integration, streaming engine setup, and front-end changes.

4. **Steam API Analysis**  
   - We analyzed existing Steam APIs to assess their compatibility with our feature and identified any gaps requiring additional development.
